# KMeans

In this project I implemented KMeans using Malahanobis and Euclidean distance and the Davies Bouldin Index so we could perform validation.

There are 3 scripts to see the compairson between the different distances used for KMeans and there is one demonstration script of the Davies Bouldin Index.

## KMeans Experiments
To run these experiments you can run:

```
python3 part_1/experiment_1.py
```

You just need to adjust the experiment number.

## Davies Bouldin Demonstration
To run these experiments you can run
```
python3 part_2/demonstration.py 
```

All the graphs that result from running these scripts are in [Graphs](Graphs)
